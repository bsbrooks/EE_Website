      <p>Atopic dermatitis,  also known as eczema, is a chronic skin condition found in infants and children but also in adults. Allergic individuals are more likely to develop atopic dermatitis.<br />
        <br />
        The main symptoms of atopic dermatitis are a rash and itching. The rash may consist of very red skin and blisters which may crust.&nbsp; Eventually, chronic excema may lead to very thick skin. Atopic dermatitis may be an allergic response to certain foods, such as eggs, peanuts, milk, wheat, or soy products. It also can be made worse with exposure to certain allergens such as dust mites and animals. Dry, cold weather and harsh soaps can also exacerbate the skin of excema patients.&nbsp; It is particulary important to control excema as it can result in severe skin infections.<br />
        <br />
        The diagnosis of atopic dermatitis consists of a physical exam and skin testing to determine which allergens may be making the skin condition worse. Many treatment options are available including avoidance of potential allergens once diagnosed and topical medications. It is important to be under the care of an allergist to determine if there is an allergic cause and to receive the proper medication in this chronic disease. <br />
        <br />
      Consult with Dr. Epstein to help diagnose whether you have atopic dermatitis and determine what allergens are making your condition worse. Appropriate medication can then be recommended.</p>
