      <p>Check your peak flows every day, or as many times as your doctor has instructed.  You may exercise or be active when your peak flow numbers are in the Green Zone (80%-100% of your best).</p>
      <p>Use your inhaler or puffer 10 to 15 minutes before you exercise or are active.</p>
      <p>Take your inhaled medication the &quot;right way&quot; to get the most out of them.  You may want to use a spacer with all of your inhalers (puffers).</p>
      <p>Use &quot;warm-up&quot; exercises before your activity and &quot;cool down&quot; slowly after it.</p>
      <p>Exercise or be active in a warm, humid place.  Winter weather or cold, dry air may cause an attack.</p>
      <p>Use a face mask or scarf, and breathe through your nose, when you are out in the cold air.</p>
      <p>Stay away from pollen, pollution, and irritants as much as possible, while you are exercising.</p>
      <p>If you start coughing, have trouble getting your breath, or have chest tightness or pain during your activity, STOP and take the prescribed medication.</p>
      <p>For safety, be active or exercise with someone. </p>
